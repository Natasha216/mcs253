1.
Project Title: VARK Questionnaire Program
*Due Date:** 11/06/25

---

2. What the project is about
This project is about creating an interactive program in Python that helps users determine their preferred learning style using the VARK model. The program asks the user a series of 16 multiple-choice questions,
 collects their responses, and calculates their learning style based on the VARK categories:

V – Visual
A– Auditory
R – Read/Write
K – Kinesthetic

---

3. What your code comprises of: How many functions? What that function is supposed to do. Any classes created? If subclass is created and if inherited from parent class.

Number of functions: 2 (inside a class)

  1. ask_questions(self) – This function displays the questions one by one, takes user input, validates it, and scores each answer according to the VARK category.
  2. show_result(self) – This function prints the total scores for each learning style and determines the dominant one.

Class created:Yes

  Class Name: VARK
Subclass created? No
Inheritance used? No inheritance from a parent class is used. This is a single standalone class.

4. What data is captured in program? What data type stores this data? Any data source?**
Captured Data:
User’s answers to each of the 16 multiple-choice questions (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'cd', etc.)
Data Types Used:

  * dict (dictionary) – Used to store all the questions and the corresponding answer-to-learning style mappings.
  * str – For storing user input choices.
  * int – For keeping track of the score for each learning style (V, A, R, K).
Data Source:

  * All the questions and the scoring chart are hardcoded in the Python file inside dictionaries.
  * No external files or databases are used.

5. How your program handles any exceptions?
The program uses a try-except block inside the ask_questions() function to handle errors related to user input.

* If the user inputs:
  * More than two letters
  * Invalid letters (not 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd')
    Then, the program raises a ValueError and prints a friendly error message, asking the user to try again.

6. Finally, the outcome. What will be the outcome upon successful execution of your code.
After the user has answered all 16 questions, the program will:

* Show the total score for each of the four learning styles (V, A, R, K).
* Print out the dominant learning style, which is the one with the highest score.

For example:


Your VARK scores:
V: 4
A: 3
R: 5
K: 4

Your dominant learning style is likely: R

7. Reflection: Include the challenges you encountered during this project. What you have learnt, and hope to improve on (if any)
Challenges Encountered:
The project itself is a huuge challenge for me as i do no fully understand this new course of coding just yet. i was struggling on how to actually get the hang of it. i struggled the most when trying to enter
the user inputs , all 16 user inputs. i typed each one of them down. it was exhausting. however, i found out that i could use a function rather method to actualy get this done without making the coding look messy
or taking up alot of space.
What I Learned:
I learn that functions help alot in building complex codings, it help keep codings in neat and ordered manner
  What I Hope to Improve:
i will work on my skills of coding more, especially polishing up on how to properly use functions and other key parts of programming.
8. Word of thanks
i would like to thank my family and friends for funding me in completing my project, couldnt have done it without them and i would also like to thank Ms Komogi to extend the due date for us to complete our projects and submit
on time.
